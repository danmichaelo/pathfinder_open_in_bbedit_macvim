# Open in BBEdit or MacVim for Pathfinder #

Two plugins to add menu entries "Open in BBEdit" and "Open in MacVim" to [PathFinder](http://www.cocoatech.com/)'s "Commands" menu. With the latest version, they don't have default shortcuts, but you can assign shortcuts under Preferences > Features -> Keyboard. I use `Cmd-Ctrl-B` and `Cmd-Ctrl-M` myself.

The plugin is based on [pathfinder_open_in_textmate](https://github.com/orta/pathfinder_open_in_textmate).

## Installation the easy way

Get compiled binaries, unzip and move into `~/Library/Application Support/Path Finder/PlugIns`:

 -   [macvim plugin](https://github.com/downloads/danmichaelo/pathfinder_open_in_bbedit_macvim/pathfinder_open_in_macvim-1.2.zip)
 -   [bbedit plugin](https://github.com/downloads/danmichaelo/pathfinder_open_in_bbedit_macvim/pathfinder_open_in_bbedit-1.2.zip)

## Installation the hard way

Clone this repo, get the [Path Finder SDK](http://www.cocoatech.com/sdk) and compile yourself.
